	# Should we pass handlers from the parent? {} - empty right now.
	# Add a new parameter in CreateBrowser() called "popupsInheritHandlers"?
	# Or maybe just an another dict "popupHandlers"? User could pass the same
	# handlers dictionary to both parameters.

	# What about popups created by popups? How do we do the inheritance in this case?

browser.pyx > CloseBrowser()

	Commented out CefBrowser.CloseBrowser()  to fix (maybe?) the memory read errors
	when closing application window. But CefBrowser.CloseBrowser() needs to be called
	for popup windows...?
