# First, it copies all .pyx files from upper directory to setup/.
# Then, fixes repeating of "include" statements in pyx files.

# Only the mainfile needs to have "include" statements,
# but we're using PyCharm and to get rid of "unresolved references"
# and other errors displayed in pycharm we are adding "include"
# statements in all of the pyx files.

# I'm not 100% sure how includes work in Cython, but I suspect that
# a few includes of the same file will include the same content more
# than once, it should work, but function and variable definitions are
# duplicated, it is some kind of overhead and it could lead to some
# problems in the future, better to fix it now.
