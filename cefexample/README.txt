CEF Python provides bindings for the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). 

Example application
	There are 2 example applications:
	- cefsimple.py
	- cefadvanced.py

Files
	cefpython.pyd - cefpython library compiled using Cython extension,
				this is a dll-like file in python world.
	cefwindow.py - functions to create window using pywin32 extension.

	DLL's and .PAK file are from "cef_binary_1.1025.607_windows.zip"
	that can be downloaded from the Chromium Embedded Framework
	project: http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/

	Manifest and msvcr90.dll are dependencies of cefpython.pyd:
		Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest
		msvcm90.dll (not really required but must be redistributed together)
		msvcp90.dll (not really required but must be redistributed together)
		msvcr90.dll
