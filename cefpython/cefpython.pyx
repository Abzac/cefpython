# IMPORTANT notes:
#
# - cdef functions returning types other than "object" (a python object)
#   should have in its declaration "except *", otherwise exceptions are ignored.
#   Those cdef that return "object" have "except *" by default.
#
# - about acquiring/releasing GIL lock, see discussion here:
#   https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cython-users/jcvjpSOZPp0
#
# - <CefRefPtr[ClientHandler]?>new ClientHandler()
#   <...?> means to throw an error if the cast is not allowed
#
# - in client handler callbacks must embrace all code in try..except otherwise
#   the error will  be ignored, only printed to the output console, this is the
#   default behavior of Cython, to remedy this you are supposed to add "except *"
#   in function declaration, unfortunately it does not work, some conflict with
#   CEF threading, see topic at cython-users for more details:
#   https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cython-users/CRxWoX57dnM/aufW3gXMhOUJ.
#
# - CTags requires all functions/methods imported in .pxd files to be preceded with "cdef",
#   otherwise they are not indexed.
