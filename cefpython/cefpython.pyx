# IMPORTANT notes:
#
# - cdef/cpdef functions returning something other than a Python object
#   should have in its declaration "except *", otherwise exceptions are
#   ignored. Those cdef/cpdef that return "object" have "except *" by 
#   default. The setup/compile.py script will check for functions missing
#   "except *" and will display an error message about that, so in most
#   cases you shouldn't worry about it.
#
# - TODO: add checking for "except * with gil" in functions with the
#   "public" keyword
#
# - about acquiring/releasing GIL lock, see discussion here:
#   https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cython-users/jcvjpSOZPp0
#
# - <CefRefPtr[ClientHandler]?>new ClientHandler()
#   <...?> means to throw an error if the cast is not allowed
#
# - in client handler callbacks must embrace all code in try..except otherwise
#   the error will  be ignored, only printed to the output console, this is the
#   default behavior of Cython, to remedy this you are supposed to add "except *"
#   in function declaration, unfortunately it does not work, some conflict with
#   CEF threading, see topic at cython-users for more details:
#   https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cython-users/CRxWoX57dnM/aufW3gXMhOUJ.
#
# - CTags requires all functions/methods imported in .pxd files to be preceded with "cdef",
#   otherwise they are not indexed.
#
# - __del__ method does not exist in Extension Types (cdef class),
#   you have to use __dealloc__ instead, try to remember that as
#   defining __del__ will not raise any warning and could lead to
#   memory leaks.
#
# - CefString.c_str() is safe to use only on Windows, on Ubuntu 64bit
#   for a "Pers" string it returns: "P\x00e\x00r\x00s\x00", which is
#   most probably not what you expected.
