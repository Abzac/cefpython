Getting chromium sources
------------------------
gclient sync fails, you need to install:
    sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev

Building
--------
building in release mode:
    # j = jobs
    make BUILDTYPE=Release -j4 cefclient

Binary package
--------------
cd /path/to/chromium/src/cef/tools
make_distrib.sh --allow-partial
If the process succeeds a binary distribution package
will be created in the /path/to/chromium/src/cef/binary_distrib directory.
